    <h3 class="subheading">About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm an aspiring Software Engineer based in London, and technology,
      gaming, web design/development have always been key areas of interest of
      mine. After my A-Levels, having decided the traditional route of going to
      university was not for me, I decided to take a gap year to work, while I
      thought about and explored possible career paths and what I wanted to do
      in life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just before the onset of the pandemic, I decided web development is
      someting I wanted to do long term and was one of the few industries that
      was largely unaffected by the lockdown. Thus, I embarked upon a journey to
      get the basics of web development down, scouring the internet for free
      resources, such as FreeCodeCamp and CodeAcademy, as well as applying for
      positions, roles and bootcamps that would allow me to develop these
      skills.
